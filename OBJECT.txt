OBJECT
	Object is an property that has "Key & value". Property of an object can be an primitive value, another object, and function.
	It are an variable too, but it has many values. Values of the object are written in the form of "Key:Value".

	PROPERTY OF AN OBJECT:
		Object property is same as ordinary variable. Property defines the characterisrics of the objects, it can be access by using two methods:
	# using dot-notation method
		Syntex: objectName.property/key name
		Example: let Person ={Name:"RajKumar", 
                           Age:28,
           		   hasHobby:true,
          		   Hobby:"Sleeping nd Phone nondifying"}
			 console.log( Person.Name );
		
	# using bracket-notation method
		Syntex: objectName[property/key name]
		Example: let Person ={Name:"RajKumar", 
                           Age:28,
           		   hasHobby:true,
          		   Hobby:"Sleeping nd Phone nondifying"}
			 console.log( Person[Name] );
		
	CREATING AN OBJECT:
		# Using literal
		# Using the keyword "new"
		# Using method "Object.create()"

	# Using literal
		Define and creat an object in the single statement. It is an list consist of Key and value pair within the curly braces. 
		Syntex:  dataType ObjectName={Key:value}
		Key is a neme of the variable, should not be an reserved words, Value is in any data type value
		Example: let idiot ={Name:"RajKumar", 
                         Age:28,
           		 hasHobby:true,
          		 Hobby:"Sleeping nd Phone nondifying"
			 function intro() {
				let i=`I am ${Name}, I like to do ${Hobby}, Thank You !!`;
			  console.log(i);
			  }
			}
		
	# Using the keyword "new"
		Define an object constructor, and then create the constructor type object.
		Object() is an special constructor function, used to create and initialize an object.
		It return the variable as value which is a referance to the new object. If retuens the value "null or undefined", it creates but returns an empty object. Otherwise it returns the type of the corresponding object
		Syntex:  dataType ObjectName= new Object();

		Example: const person = new Object();

	# Using method "Object.create()"
		It is an static method to creat an new object. In this method, existing object is used as prototype to create new object.
		Syntex: Object.create( parameters )

	OBJECT is MUTABLE which means it is addressed by referance
